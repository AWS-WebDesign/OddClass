<h1>My Reuccuring Dream</h1>

  <p>When I was a kid, I always had this dream that I went on a grand adventure. My parents were wheat farmers and I had to leave them. I was running through the spooky cartoon woods in Scooby Doo and then stumbled upon my bathroom, uprooted and in the forest. My brother's two tall friends (who I was afraid of) told me they would take all of my stuffed animals. To save them, I frantically piled them all into my bathroom, but then a ghostly monster (like a dementor) kept trying to push itself inside the room and eat me. I locked one door, then ran and locked the other, but a trapdoor appeared in the floor and the monster came and possibly ate me.</p>
