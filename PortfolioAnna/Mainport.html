    <div class="porttitle">
      <!--Each word of this title is a seperately id'd span so that I could apply special css styling to each. In this case,
    there is a different animation applied to each word so that they fade onto the screen at different times. Ids are like classes,
  which are basically ways of linking elements to their css stylings to give them unique properties and settings. Below is an h1, which
is essentially just regular text that has been bolded and centered. A span is just a short line of text. -->

    <!--Below is the navigation bar for my webpage. It contains links, or a (anchors) to all of my main projects. It will appear as one bar with hoverable
  elements that, when clicked, will lead to the html pages listed. The white text is what it will appear like. Each anchor is inside a span, which I mainly did
so that I could style the spans different than the anchors so the hoverable elements would be easy to make. All of the code before the html page in "" is
telling the page how to navigate to each html document. For example, for the Family Tree webpage, the system will leave this folder (PortfolioAnna) as shown by
the ".." and then it will go inside the folder "FamilyTreeFolder" and then it will access the document "me.html". The same process happens for each respective link below.

The div has a special class used for styling, but divs are basically just used to organize and style large chunks of text.

Inside the anchor (a), href is saying which file will be accessed when the element is clicked. The white text in >< is what will show up.

The id is also for specific styling. -->

      <!--This is the opening paragraph (p). Since it has an animation fading it in, I gave it a special id (opening) so I could adjust its
    attributes. It will just appear as a paragraph at the top of the page.-->
      <p id="opening">Welcome to my portfolio of this semester's web design projects. This semester,
        we worked primarily with html and css. Since I was learning the coding languages as
      we created projects, the first projects are much more simplistic than the later ones. From
    paragraphs and relative links to complicated forms and animations, my development of skills
  is very clear from my informative, yet simple, Bison document, to my Javascript-reliant Buzzfeed Quiz
with interactive responses and hoverable elements. Below, you can access and learn about the processes
behind each project, or just click the links above for quick access. </p>
<!--This is another big div for all of my information blurbs about each project. -->
    <div class="portinfo">
      <!--Here is the div for just the section about the family tree. It has a weird image format so I gave it its own div. Also, I made it so that when this whole
    section is hovered over, the header will appear as underlined so the user will know it's a link. This is true for all of the below headers as I changed all of their
  respective divs. -->
      <div class="familytreediv">
        <!--Here's another header (h1) with class pagetitle so that it appears special (see css document). As you can see, it is also an anchor (a)
      and so will be a clickable link. This one is also hoverable. You can see how me.html was accessed the same as it was above. -->
        <h1 class="pagetitle"><a href="../FamilyTreeFolder/me.html">Family Tree</a></h1>
        <!--Here is my first paragraph. It is a simple paragraph, and only has a class so I could adjust its spacing. -->
        <p class="inforight">As one of the first projects of the year, the family tree project involved using hyperlinks to
          navigate between very basic webpages. This particular project included links to information about
          many of my family members.</p>
          <!--This image (img) will appear as the image screenshotjames.png (src attribute says which image to use -- alt attribute shows the text
          that will show up if the image doesn't load) which is a screenshot of one of my family tree pages. I gave it a border in
        css so it will have a lavender border. There is a paragraph also, as well as another image with similar formatting, and yet another paragraph.
      They all have their own ids so that I could change their padding and margins so they would be spaced correctly. -->

        <p id="familypara">In the three documents, there is a picture and description of each of my siblings. You can find this on

<!--Here is the div for the next section about a project. This section is about the Bison project. The div class colorblock is used a couple times because I decided
that every other section will have a darker background color so that the overall webpage looks prettier. The id of spacebelow is pretty straightforward. It applies to a
css function that puts more padding beneath the whole thing as a result of some spacing issues I had. -->
      <div class="colorblock" id="spacebelow">
        <!--This header is basically laid out as before, but with the html document Bison.html. -->
        <h1 class="pagetitle"><a href="../BisonProject/Bison.html">Bison Project</a></h1>
        <!--As you will notice, this div repeats in every section. This is because I gave every section a larger paragraph on the right of the screen so that, even though
      a lot of the images and minor paragraphs were formatted differently, they still had some uniformity accross them. -->
        <div class="inforight">
          The Bison project consists of a single page explaining some basic facts about a certain animal. Each person chose an
          animal, and I chose Bison. The page is more advanced, including pictures, background colors, and more unique styling. There was
          no real css document related to it at this point, but I added one in so I could style the portfolio bar for this project. As part of our animations work, I added an animation to this project. Explore
          the webpage to find out what it is!

      often define these in the opening tags of images and videos because it is easier for me to locate, as I change them often as I create the webpage.

    The autoplay attribute means that the video will start playing as soon as possible.
    However, the controls attribute gives the video pause and play buttons, and so it will not play automatically.

  It has an id because I gave it a border and changed some of its spacing.

The white text "toothpick video" will show up if the browser does not support this video.  -->

          My first real use of Javascript, this project involved creating a playable Buzzfeed Quiz with at least five outcomes. My quiz
          tested the user to see which Scooby Doo Mystery Inc. member they were. I had to use a variable system in Javascript to track the results,
          giving each possible multiple choice answer a point value to be counted at the end. I also used a text bar for the user to input their name,
          which was then incorporated into the answer. The answer has a visibility of 'hidden,' and only appears after the submit button is clicked.
          This is my most entertaining project.

        on the homepage. It also uses an audio file. The project has multiple pages, though a grey color scheme is consistent throughout.
