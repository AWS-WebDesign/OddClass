<h1>Benefits of being Anonymous</h1>
<p>Some benfits with anonymity is having an online community where you feel safe and comfortable speaking
about topics that are important to you. For example, you are able to connect with people who either are apart of the
same community such as the LGBTQ+ community. Young teens or adults are able to communicate on issues that are facing in their
everyday life with their unaccepting or accepting enviornment that they are living in. And also connect with others in either
the same country or internationally! This is a way for young teens to connect and build stronger relationships.</p>
