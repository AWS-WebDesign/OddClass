    <p>Anonymity undoubtedly has its perks. When you first create that anonymous account, you are virtually free to
      say anything to the internet world without having any reprocussions.
       However, there's always another side to the coin. Are the risks of anonymity
    worth the rewards? In this section, we'll discuss the drawbacks of anonymity, which often manifest in the form of
  hate crimes, cyberbulling, illegal discussions and child trafficking. </p>

  <p>This video lists many different forms of cyberbullying. While some, like exclusion, involves familiar people
  to the victim, many, like stalking and stealing accounts, utilizes anonymity to fulfill these tasks.
  <span>Around 37% of teens say they've been cyberbullied at some point in their life. </span></p>

While it may benefit online users, anonymity makes the FBI's job much harder. <br>

<center><h2>What Internet Users have to say:</h2></center>
<p>Internet users value our anonimity. According to a Pew Research study, 68% of internet users
think their privacy is not protected enough online. 50% of users are worried about how much information
about them is online. The most important thing to keep hidden to them is their email information.
</p>

<p>You may be thinking this has more to do with privacy. However, the two are closely related.
One cyber security store put it this way: privacy is when users know who you are but cannot see what you
type or do, while anonymity is when users can see what you do, but don't know who you are. </p>
