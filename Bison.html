  <p>Bison are really cool animals! Here's some fun facts! Bisons are the United States of America's national mammal. They're also the biggest mammal in North America, with the males weighing up to 2,000 pounds. Bison's scientific name is Bison bison bison. Another fun fact:
    <strong>"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo"</strong>
    <em>is a grammatically correct sentence!</em> Crazy, right?</p>
    <p>Here's another fun fact: baby Bison are called 'red dogs'! Another (slightly scary) fact is that Bison can run at 35 miles per hour. But they are nearsighted so if they don't smell or hear you, you'll probably be safe. </p>
