    <h2>The Plastic Problem</h2>
      <p>Tacoma sends 165,000 tons of waste to landfill each year, and a total of 378,000 tons when including recycling and composting.
         Though the city of Tacoma has plans to implement new waste management facilities and increase public education, there is still much work to be done.
         Community involvement will greatly impact this goal. One major contributor to waste globally is single-use plastic pollution. If the current trends
         continue, by 2050 the world will have produced 26 billion tons of plastic waste to flood the planet. By aiming to consume
         less single-use or overly packaged goods, Tacoma residents can reduce our waste while adopting cleaner and more intentional lifestyles. </p>

    <h2>The Zero Waste Lifestyle</h2>
      <p>The zero waste lifestyle involves living everyday life while sending the least amount of trash to landfill. Mother <strong>Bea Johnson</strong>, known as the founder of the zero waste movement, is a social media influencer who preaches the zero waste lifestyle and all of its benefits.
"Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rot (and only in that order) is my family’s secret to reducing our annual trash to a jar since 2008" says Bea. Her website and book are both called 'Zero Waste Home.'</p>
<span>Here are some zero waste tips generally advised by the zero waste community:</span>

<ul>
  <div class="heading">

  </div>
          <ul>
              <li>plastic water bottles -- reusable metal water bottle</li>
              <li>plastic cutlery -- metal or bamboo (compostable) cutlery</li>
              <li>paper coffee cups -- reusable glass or plastic coffee cup</li>
              <li>paper napkin -- hankerchief or cloth napkin</li>
              <li>plastic wrap -- beeswax wraps </li>

            </ul>
      </li> <br>
      <div class="heading">
          <li><strong>In the bathroom, follow these steps:</strong>

          <li>buy silk dental floss (which is compostable)</li>

      <div class="heading">
        <li><strong>In the kitchen and when shopping for food, consider these options:</strong>
      </div>
      <ul>
            <li>buy as much as you can from the bulk section of the store. You can thrift, reuse or buy glass jars to store your bulk food in.</li>
            <li>look for companies that support the planet and use recycled materials (and are recycleable themselves)</li>
            <li>bring fabric produce bags to the store instead of the plastic ones offered</li>
            <li>bring a fabric tote bag to carry groceries in</li>
            <li>check your fridge before shopping to make sure you are only buying what you don't have enough of</li>
            <li>try to meal prep at the beginning of the week</li>
            <li>have a compost and recycling bin accessable in your kitchen, and educate yourself on what can go in each bin</li>
            <li>make your own bread or buy it using a cloth bread bag</li>
            <li>avoid or eat less animal products</li>
            <li>make nut milk, yogurt, bread, ice cream and general meals at home</li>
            <li>grease baking sheets instead of using parchment paper or tinfoil</li>
          </ul>
      </li> <br>

          <li><strong>As for clothing:</strong>
      </div>
            <ul>
                <li>use the clothing site 'good on you' to find ethical brands</li>
                <li>try not to follow extreme fashion trends that will go out of style</li>
                <li>donate your clothes when you are done with them, upcycle them, or use the fabric as a rag or something else</li>
                <li>thrift everything you can! Tacoma has a lively thrift scene:
                  <div class="byme">
                    <br>urban exchange <br>
                    megs n mo <br> jankuland <br> good will <br> value village <br>
                   the discovery shop <br> scorpio rising <br>
                  </div>
                  ...are only some of the tons of great options.</li>
            </ul>
      </li>
</ul>

</video> <br>

<span>All in all, try to shop smart, buy less, reuse what you have, thrift what you don't, and recycle or compost it all when you're done. </span>
