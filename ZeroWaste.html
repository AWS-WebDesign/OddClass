        <h1>Plastic Pollution and the Zero Waste Lifestyle</h1>

    <h2>The Plastic Problem</h2>
      <p>Tacoma sends 165,000 tons of waste to landfill each year, and a total of 378,000 tons when including recycling and composting.
         Though the city of Tacoma has plans to implement new waste management facilities and increase public education, there is still much work to be done.
         Community involvement will greatly impact this goal. One major contributor to waste globally is single-use plastic pollution. If the current trends
         continue, by 2050 the world will have produced 26 billion tons of plastic waste to flood the planet. By aiming to consume
         less single-use or overly packaged goods, Tacoma residents can reduce our waste while adopting cleaner and more intentional lifestyles. </p>

    <h2>The Zero Waste Lifestyle</h2>
      <p>The zero waste lifestyle involves living everyday life while sending the least amount of trash to landfill. Mother <strong>Bea Johnson</strong>, known as the founder of the zero waste movement, is a social media influencer who preaches the zero waste lifestyle and all of its benefits.
"Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rot (and only in that order) is my familyâ€™s secret to reducing our annual trash to a jar since 2008" says Bea. Her website and book are both called 'Zero Waste Home.'</p>
<span>Here are some zero waste tips generally advised by the zero waste community:</span>

      </div>
      <ul>

            <li>try to meal prep at the beginning of the week</li>
            <li>have a compost and recycling bin accessable in your kitchen, and educate yourself on what can go in each bin</li>
            <li>make your own bread or buy it using a cloth bread bag</li>
            <li>avoid or eat less animal products</li>
            <li>make nut milk, yogurt, bread, ice cream and general meals at home</li>

          <li><strong>As for clothing:</strong>
      </div>
            <ul>
                <li>use the clothing site 'good on you' to find ethical brands</li>
                <li>try not to follow extreme fashion trends that will go out of style</li>

                <li>thrift everything you can! Tacoma has a lively thrift scene:
                  <div class="byme">
                    <br>urban exchange <br>
                    megs n mo <br> jankuland <br> good will <br> value village <br>

            </ul>
      </li>
</ul>
