The font family is "Kavoon," which is a google font that is linked in the html page. The text-align: center
makes the text centered. The border-style creates a border for the title, but i've made the top, left and right
borders equal to none so that there's only a bottom border. This effectively just makes a line beneath the text.
The line in this case will be white and 10 pixels thick, as specified in the code.*/

I made the width 30%, so its width is 30% of its possible browser space. The border will appear dotted as that is how the border-style
is defined. The border will also be white and 6 pixels thick, as shown in the code. The margin-top just makes a little bit of space
above the text box for styling. The padding makes the walls of the textbox 20 pixels away from the text. The font will be 20 pixels in size.
The background of the text box will be DarkSeaGreen and the text color will be white. The font will be as the font type "Kavoon."*/

text that shows up that tells the user which scooby doo character they are. The display is 'none' because this information
will not show until the user completes the quiz and clicks 'submit.' The font of this box is 40 pixels in size, the font type is
fantasy, and the text alignment is center, so the text will be centered. The border-style element creates a border around the text.
The border-style is double so the text will be surrounded by double lines. The border will be 10 pixels thick and white. The background color
will be sea green. The padding as 100 means that there is 100 pixels of space between the text and the border. */

next to each other evenly. The margin is 5 px to make space around each answer. There is a border,
as shown by the border-style. In this case, the border is solid, white, and 3 pixels wide. The padding
controls make it so that there is one pixel of space on the top, left and right of everything within the style.

/*This applies to inputs that are 'button' types. This means it'll apply to the submit button

The background will be white and the text color will be sea green. The font style will be 'kavoon' and the font will be 30 pixels in size.
The border radius is 8 which means that the corners will be fairly rounded. The higher the border radius number, the rounder the corners.
The display is a 'block', which is important to define it as a block so that I can later define the display as 'none' and make it dissapear.
The display of block just makes the entire thing act like a block- it doesn't do much. The margin-left and margin-right are both 30%, as since
the width is 40%, this adds to 100%. Basically, 30% of the page will always be space on the left, and another 30% will be space on the right
of the submit button. I used this to essentially keep the button always centered, because the text-align control does not apply to the entire
element. */
