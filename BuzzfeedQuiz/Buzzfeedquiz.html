<!--This is the html document for my buzzfeed quiz. It holds all of the elements and content of this quiz, though the styling takes place
within my css file. This quiz will function so that the user will input their name and answer five questions asked of them. When they click submit,
the submit button will dissapear and a text box will appear that will tell them which Mystery Inc. character from the show 'scooby doo' they are.
The possible characters are Shaggy, Velma, Scooby, Fred, or Daphne. -->

        <!--Here is a span asking the user a question. Its id of name intro will be consistent for all of the questions that are asked of the user.
      A span is basically a section of text that is shorter than a paragraph. The element <br> makes a line break, and works basically as a return tab.
      It is used here for spacing purposes so that the input that comes next appears one line below it.

        <!--This is an input element. Input is where the user puts in information to interact with the form.
      The type attribute is 'text' which means that this particular input will appear as a text box as seen in standard forms.
    The id is used later in the javascript to cite this to collect the data that the user inputs. The maxlength attribute means
  that the text that the user inputs cannot be more than 15 characters long. The value attribute describes what will show up
in the text box when it is defaulted. In this case, the text box will have the word "User" inside of it when the page is loaded. A <br>
element is used for spacing. -->

<!--Everything within this div applies to the first question in the quiz. A div groups elements together and makes it so that styles can
be applied to a group of attributes easily. I made a div for the whole question so that it is divided neatly and so that I can add more spacing

              and also so that I can define everything within the class 'scoobydiv' as blocks and make them float left (in the css document) so that
            they all line up next to each other. The elements within the div below will appear as a box with an image, a small line of text that says
          "scooby snacks" and an input button. -->

                is an image called 'scoob.jpg' as seen in my buzzfeed quiz folder. The height and width attributes control the height and width of the image.
              The 'alt' attribute will appear if the image doesn't load. The span is just a regular span, but I used it to label the input. By putting the image
            and span as content of the label, when the user clicks on any part of the label or input (including the image and text), the input will be checked. The
          label element has the attribute 'for' to describe which input it applies to. It applies to the input with an id of 'scoobysnack'.-->

                when the content is clicked (including when the label is clicked). The value and name are practically useless in a checkbox as no content appears
              as a result of these controls, but I kept it in originally because I was unsure if I was going to make code that applied to the input's value or name.
            I made the name, value and id the same so that if a control applies to the value rather than the id, it will not be an issue.  -->

              the width so that they are somewhat uniform in their appearance, even if by doing so some of the images are slightly distorted. I describe over each
            div which character points the input is associated with. For example, if the 'pizza' input is clicked, points will be added to the variable velma, so the
          user is more likely to be told they are like velma in the end. This data is collected through the action 'getElementById' in javascript. As you can see, I have
        five variables, one that corresponds with each possible output for a character. -->

        <!--This is a 'button' input which means that, when clicked, it'll do something. In this case the 'onclick' attribute
      triggers the function 'showInput()' which is a javascript function. The javascript function, as seen below, will count the answers
    and display in the paragraph id='finalanswer' which mystery inc character they are. The value is how the button will appear, which is
  as words saying 'SUBMIT!'. The id of submit is cited down below in the javascript document. -->

      </form>
      <!--This information is outside the form. It has an initial display of 'none' which means that it'll be hidden. However, I have
    a javascript code that changes this from 'none' to 'block' after the submit button is clicked. The id of nameoutput will correspond
  with what the user put in as their name. If they don't put in anything, it'll appear as 'user'. The second span will display text saying
which gang member they are. The id of this span is 'gangmember'. The next span with the class 'resetspecs' and id of 'resetbutton ' is a link that
will reset the page. I used the class of resetspecs to define the styling of the reset button, while I used the id to cite it in my javascript so that it'll
appear only when the submit button is clicked. It links to the html document, which effectively just resets the page. -->
      <p id="Finalanswer">
      <span id="nameoutput">user</span>? More like <span id="gangmember"></span> <br> <br>

will appear as the text that is inside the anchor that I said. The h3 of sources is just to title this area. The breaks are so that each source appears on a new line. -->
