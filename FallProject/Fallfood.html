                                Want to travel without leaving your town? Cook's tavern has rotating themes from
                              places around the world, including cultural art, food, and a display in the front. This is
                            a great restaurant to cozy up in with your family.</p>

                      for dessert. My family and I have gone here for as long as I can remember, and the warm and welcoming
                    environment makes it a place to return to. </p>
