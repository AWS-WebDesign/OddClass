                <img width=360px height=540px id= sodaimg src="soda.jpg" alt="A soda bottle halloween costume" >
                <p>This costume is an easy hit! To make it, gather these simple items:
                      <ul>
                        <li>A single-colored bright dress or shirt/pants combo</li>
                        <li>A pie tin (for the hat)</li>
                        <li>Colored paper and glue</li>
                        <li>Colored fabric and scissors (or fabric pens)</li>
                        <li>A bottle of soda pop</li>
                      </ul> <br>
                  Simply decorate the dress to match the soda pop of your choosing, and use fun paper to make the ridges of the
                  pie tin hat. Use paper to give the lid a label if you want also. This is a great costume to do with
                  friends.

                <img width= 294.5px height= 442.4 id= sodaimg src="sushi.jpg" alt="A sashimi halloween costume">
                <p>This one is even easier than the first. Here's what you'll need:
                    <ul>
                      <li>An all-white outfit or casual dress</li>
                      <li>Cardboard</li>
                      <li>Dark Green fabric</li>
                      <li>Orange and white paint</li>
                      <li>A plain headband and glue</li>
                      <li>Green paper</li>
                      <li>Scissors</li>
                    </ul>
                    Measure the fabric around your waist and sew it so you can easily take it on and off. Cut the cardboard into
                    a rectangle and paint it like a fish with the paint. Let this dry. Cut the green paper into spikes and glue
                    it onto the headband for the grass part. Glue the cardboard's back to the green waistbelt and wear this over
                    your white dress.

                  <li>Around 20 black pom-poms</li>
                  <li>A paper towel roll</li>
                  <li>A headband</li>
                  <li>pink paper</li>

                Glue the pom-poms onto the dress. For the headband, wrap pink paper around the
