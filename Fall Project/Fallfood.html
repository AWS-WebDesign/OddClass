      <h1>Fall Food Favorites!</h1>
      <span> Here we have plenty of places to eat on chilly fall days here
      in the beautiful city of Tacoma, as well as some delicious sweet treats
    that you can make with your fall produce or just to embrace the festivity
  of fall. </span>
    <h2>Delicious places to eat</h2>
    <h3>Cook's Tavern</h3>
    <p>Cook's tavern is a family favorite, offering hearty meals and good service.
    Want to travel without leaving your town? Cook's tavern has rotating themes from
  places around the world, including cultural art, food, and a display in the front. This is
a great restaurant to cozy up in with your family.</p>
    <h3>The Rosewood Café</h3>
    <p>Just down the street from Cook's Tavern, the Rosewood café is a Tacoma classic. Drop in here
    for lunch or a casual dinner. They have delicious sandwiches, daily soups and great, warm cookies
  for dessert. My family and I have gone here for as long as I can remember, and the warm and welcoming
environment makes it a place to return to. </p>
    <h3>Pho Than Brothers</h3>
    <p>Down by the University of Washington, this statewide Pho chain is highly recommended. Go here for a delicious,
    warm meal. Maybe stop by the Tacoma Art Museum nearby for an entertaining afternoon with your family. The Children's
  Museum of Tacoma is nearby as well if you have young kids or younger siblings. </p>
    <h2>Fun Recipes for the Whole Family</h2>
    <h3>Pumpkin Bread</h3>
    <p>My family's favorite fall recipe, this delicious pumpkin bread can be baked into muffins! Also, if you add orange butter,
    you can turn this delicious snack into a cozy Fall dessert.</p>
